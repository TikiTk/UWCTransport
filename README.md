Uwc transport programme
This is the application break down.
Please use university colours, it should be something simple but beautify and user friendly.
Create a web application for residential service transport. The application must accommodate both Students and staff members since they are using transport from one department. The application must allow booking and cancellations, send booking confirmation to student and staff. If the transport is fully booked it must send rejection message both staff and Student. The application must be flexible (allow admin to do changes in terms of time) since residential services use Students as their drivers and allows the admin to view bookings. Students and staff must receive a unique booking id. Lastly the must be able to keep the booking records.

There are four Actors in the system.
CHC STUDENT are the people voted by residence students they like SRC of residence so they have different privileges when they book for transport for example they can book a car with a driver to go to functions while normal residence students cannot.
NORMAL STUDENT, like me, can only book to transport their furniture from one UWC Residence to another and in emergency cases like hospital.
Stuff are the people working under residential and catering services (RCS) and they can book to drive a car so they don't need a driver if they have licence if not then they book like CHC members.
ADMIN: using google app script to view bookings and other system details from google drive.

Business Rules Draft:
1.	1 Res student can only make 1 booking.
2.	1 booking can be made by exactly 1 student.
3.	1 staff can only make 1 booking.
